        <div class="title">You’re going to Orlando and you’ll be going to Disney and Universal. You booked tickets for Disney the first day and universal for the next day. Day one, you checked the weather and it’s showing it’s going to rain but you already got the tickets and it’s too late to get the refund. After the experience of Disney, you just didn’t feel like going and saw that it might rain a little.</div>
